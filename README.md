# 7.8-Design-Patterns-Singleton-Factory-Builder-
Sure, let's dive into each of these design patterns:

1. **Singleton Pattern**:
   The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful when you want to ensure that there's only one instance of a class throughout the application. It's commonly used for resources that are expensive to create or manage, such as database connections, thread pools, or logging systems.

   Here's a basic implementation in Java:
   ```java
   public class Singleton {
       private static Singleton instance;
   
       private Singleton() {}
   
       public static Singleton getInstance() {
           if (instance == null) {
               instance = new Singleton();
           }
           return instance;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Factory Pattern**:
   The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It's useful when you have a superclass with multiple subclasses and you want to delegate the responsibility of object instantiation to these subclasses.

   Here's a simple example in Java:
   ```java
   interface Product {
       void operation();
   }
   
   class ConcreteProduct implements Product {
       @Override
       public void operation() {
           System.out.println("Doing operation in ConcreteProduct");
       }
   }
   
   class Factory {
       public static Product createProduct() {
           return new ConcreteProduct();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Builder Pattern**:
   The Builder pattern is used to construct a complex object step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is useful when you have an object with many possible configurations, and you want to make the construction process more flexible and readable.

   Here's an example in Java:
   ```java
   class Product {
       private String part1;
       private String part2;
   
       public void setPart1(String part1) {
           this.part1 = part1;
       }
   
       public void setPart2(String part2) {
           this.part2 = part2;
       }
   
       @Override
       public String toString() {
           return "Product{" +
                   "part1='" + part1 + '\'' +
                   ", part2='" + part2 + '\'' +
                   '}';
       }
   }
   
   class ProductBuilder {
       private Product product;
   
       public ProductBuilder() {
           product = new Product();
       }
   
       public ProductBuilder withPart1(String part1) {
           product.setPart1(part1);
           return this;
       }
   
       public ProductBuilder withPart2(String part2) {
           product.setPart2(part2);
           return this;
       }
   
       public Product build() {
           return product;
       }
   }
   ```

   Example usage:
   ```java
   Product product = new ProductBuilder()
                       .withPart1("Part 1")
                       .withPart2("Part 2")
                       .build();
   ```

These design patterns provide solutions to common software design problems and promote code reuse, flexibility, and maintainability.
